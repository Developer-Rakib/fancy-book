The boy has deep attachment with his flock but realizing that they are devoid of aesthetic sense and appreciation for nature which he beholds, loves and admires, the course of his life changes. His parents' life is associated with struggle in a country which people from far away fantasize and romanticize but for them it's not a place of dream and charm.",

However, what's imperative is that a person possesses one. Why do I say this? Because dreams are the language of God. We're all placed here with a purpose and Personal Legend (what we've always wanted to accomplish)",

I would highly recommend this book to everyone! It's a wonderful story that will motivate you, inspire you and make you look at things in a different, ",

I found it simplistic and not really all that interesting. It is supposed to be inspirational but I found it hallow and empty. Its founded on some magic-y premises. I frankly found it misguided at best, harmful at worst. I wouldn't recommend anyone read it for advice or inspiration. Do not recommend",

It is filled with wisdom and life lessons and though the story is fictional, one can easily related with the main character's desire to fulfill an almost 'impossible' dream. The reviewer who said that this book is about chasing things and worldly possessions has completely missed the mark.",

I believe it to be a great book for teenagers. The alchemist also introduces any beginner to the world of spirituality. From an objective stand-point I would consider that the idea's proposed to this book should be considered",
